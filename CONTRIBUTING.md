# Contributing to Trashbot

## "I think Trashbot should be able to XXX"

1. Make sure someone didn't already file something "close enough".
2. File an issue.
3. If you really want it done, create a fork, do it yourself, then submit a PR.

## "I found a bug"

1. Nice.
2. See above.

## "I got a PR for you"

Woah, slow down! Before you even think about submitting a PR:

1. Test it yourself, it's pretty easy to create your own testing server and bot.
2. Format your code using `cargo fmt`.
3. Make sure the code is warning free with `cargo clippy`.
4. Make sure the code is high-quality. Trashbot is not garbage, the things it does are.
5. No nightly rust features. Seriously, it's a Discord bot, what could you possibly need?

## "Ok now can I submit my PR?"

Okay, fine
